   A friend got this as part of her online leftists' reading club and since I've been facing trouble reading since last 6 months and this book being less than 100 pages long, I thought I would give it a try to get back into the habit. I never read anything related to feminism or infact something like a manifesto. As a man, I wouldn't call myself a feminist and at best aim to be a feminist ally with some holdover guilt.

   Right from the outset, the authors were very precise on what they wanted to convey - to align goals of feminism with the broader activism for unaffordable housing, poverty wages, inadequate healthcare, border policing and climate change - and - to distance themselves from the corporate 'lean in'/'liberal' feminism.

  I discovered this book when I accidentally stumbled upon a very excellent but unceremonious [NYTimes Review](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/books/review-languages-of-truth-salman-rushdie-essays.html). I haven't read much since last august (except 2 books) and two books of Rushdie's are sitting idly in my kindle catching digital dust, yet I really wanted to read this for no other reason apart from the fact that the reviewer mentioned "The Underground Railroad" and "Lincoln in the Bardo" - two books, that did not infact collect dust, digital or otherwise and that I immensely enjoyed - as a defense against rushdie's take. I wanted to buy it and like all good impulse buys you ask a dear friend for affirmation and an affirmative yes is what i got and went with it.

The book starts quite innocuosly about "Wonder Tales" and how books, stories, songs shape us as children and nourish our imagination.

> They heard and read stories and they fell in love with them, Mickey in the night kitchen with magic bakers who all looked like Oliver Hardy,and Peter Pan, who thought death would be an awfully big adventure, and Bilbo Baggins under a mountain winning a riddle contest against a strange creature who had lost his precious, and the act of falling in love with stories awakened something in the children that would nourish them all their lives: their imagination.

And how we forget them as we become adults. This quote is a good way to show how Rushdie adds his own flair to each sentence.

> For some of them, stories began to seem irrelevant, unnecessary: kids’ stuff. These were sad people, and we must pity them and try not to think of them as stupid boring philistine losers.

Even though I'm not a big reader, a lot of my thoughts echo his's and even more, he gives structure and vocabulary to my own nebulous thoughts.

> I believe that the books and stories we fall in love with make us who we are, or, not to claim too much, that the act of falling in lovewith a book or story changes us in some way, and the beloved tale becomes a part of our picture of the world, a part of the way in which we understand things and make judgements and choices in our daily lives. As adults, falling in love less easily, we may end up with only a handful of books that we can truly say we love. Maybe this is why wemake so many bad judgements.

> Childhood, as A. E. Housman reminds us in ‘The Land of Lost Content’, often also called ‘Blue Remembered Hills’, is the country to which we all once belonged and will all eventually lose:\
   \
   Into my heart an air that kills\
   From yon far country blows:\
   What are those blue remembered hills,\
   What spires, what farms are those?


The fact that my own childhood seems so far away and distant is echoed so wonderfully in this pithy quote.
